# TestEngineClassMarkerApp
 I had learned Java EE backend from www.brain-mentors.com. After this, I had built an application using Java EE fundamentals like Servlet, Java Server Pages(JSP), HTML, CSS, Log4j, Java collections, Java OOPS concepts, and Apache Tomcat 8.x+. I had used the Apache Tomcat Server, which has by default port number is 8080. My main objective to build this app is to learn Java EE in deep.
